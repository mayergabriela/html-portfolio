<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Gabriela.
  I'm 36 years old, I live in Buenos Aires Argentina. 
  I 'm married. My husband's name is Matias. He is a DevOps Engenieer and We've been married for 8 years now.
  I have two kids, Uriel, who is seven years old and he has Autism and Gael, who is 1 year and 5 months old.
  We also have a cat named Orion.</p>

<p>I've started to study Web Development because I wanted to be at home a little more.
   I'm a Licensed Nurse, I used to work in ICU a lot but I found myself away of home most of the time and I wasn't able to help my kids 
  so I decided to change my life and started studying in order to became a Developer.</p>

<p>I started University and then I looked for Bootcamps and courses so I could improve myself. And here I am, pushing myself in order to improve.
  I hope I was able to entretain you a little.

  Best regards.
</p>
<p>Ga</p>
